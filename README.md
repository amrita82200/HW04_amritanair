# HW04_amritanair
In this HW I wanted to do a better model and use either a Faster-CNN or a detectron. 
However, I was facing extreme difficulties and tried to switch gears back to something simpler like a basic CNN to have something better to turn in. 
This did not work out unfortunatly, so I have turned in the work that I do have. 
It was based off of HW3 in an attempt to build off of what I have done even if it was not the best.
